The project isn't hosted yet because it's incomplete (around 40% complete). For those who want to run on localhost, please download the api: https://github.com/gusmaooleo/api-snakegame and db model (postgres). The entire project is in node.js - list of dependencies on package.json.

note:
Works well on windows not bad in mac. About: linux, ios, android... i don't know if it works.
